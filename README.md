# Mortality Rate Analysis

A comprehensive data science project featuring advanced machine learning algorithms and interactive visualizations for analyzing global mortality patterns, detecting anomalies, and correlating them with historical events. This repository contains both the original Jupyter notebook with detailed data analysis and an interactive Streamlit web application.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series forecasting to identify unusual mortality patterns across different countries and time periods. The system implements multiple anomaly detection algorithms and provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.

## üìä Data

### Data Source

The project uses data from the **Human Mortality Database (HMD)**, a collaborative project between the University of California, Berkeley (USA) and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). The HMD provides detailed mortality and population data for over 40 countries or areas, with some series extending back to the 19th century.

- **Website**: [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/)
- **Coverage**: 40+ countries/regions
- **Time Span**: Some data extends back to the 1800s
- **Quality**: High-quality, validated demographic data
- **Standardization**: Consistent methods applied across all countries

The HMD is widely used in demographic research, epidemiology, and public health studies due to its comprehensive coverage and methodological consistency.

### Data Structure

The application uses mortality data with the following structure:
- **Country**: Country identifier
- **Year**: Year of data collection
- **Sex**: Gender classification (1=Male, 2=Female)
- **Total**: Total mortality count
- **Age-specific columns**: Mortality by age groups (d0, d1, d5, d10, etc.)

*Note: If the original data file is not found, the application will generate sample data for demonstration purposes.*


## üî¨ Methodology

### Anomaly Detection Methods

1. **Z-Score Method**
   - Identifies data points that deviate significantly from the mean
   - Configurable threshold (typically 2-3 standard deviations)

2. **IQR (Interquartile Range)**
   - Identifies outliers based on the interquartile range
   - Robust to extreme values

3. **Moving Average**
   - Identifies points that deviate from local trends
   - Adaptive to temporal patterns

4. **Machine Learning Approaches**
   - Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection
   - One-Class SVM for novelty detection
   - LSTM Autoencoders for temporal pattern recognition

### Excess Mortality Calculation

1. **Baseline Estimation**: Calculate expected mortality using historical averages
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Determine 95% confidence bounds using t-distribution
3. **Excess Calculation**: Compute difference between actual and expected mortality
4. **Statistical Significance**: Identify statistically significant deviations

### Historical Event Correlation

The system includes a comprehensive database of historical events:
- **Pandemics**: COVID-19, H1N1, SARS, HIV/AIDS, Hong Kong Flu
- **Conflicts**: Wars, civil conflicts, terrorist attacks
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, cyclones
- **Policy Changes**: Healthcare reforms, reunifications
- **Environmental Events**: Heat waves, climate-related mortality
